To protect sensitive information, robust data security measures must be implemented. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Access management to control user permissions.
    \item Sensitive information labeling to identify and protect critical data.
    \item Secure communication channels to prevent data breaches and tampering \cite{data_security_15}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Governance and Standardization}

Data governance frameworks ensure that data is managed securely and efficiently. Centralized repositories, tied to enterprise authentication services, facilitate secure access and modification permissions. Implementing data standardization practices, such as labeling and naming conventions, further enhances data integrity and usability.
