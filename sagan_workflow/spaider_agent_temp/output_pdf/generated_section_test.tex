\section{Explanations on the Management of Ethical Issues and Data Protection}

The integration of autonomous AI agents in spacecraft operations presents significant ethical and data protection challenges. As AI systems become more prevalent in space missions, it is crucial to address these issues to ensure responsible and trustworthy AI deployment. This section outlines the ethical considerations and data protection strategies pertinent to the development and deployment of AI systems in the aerospace industry.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}

The use of AI in space systems raises numerous ethical questions, particularly concerning decision-making, bias, accountability, and privacy. A report by the British House of Commons highlights these issues, emphasizing the need for transparent decision-making processes and minimizing bias \cite{house_of_commons_report}. The European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) has published the "Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI," which provide a framework for ethical AI development \cite{ai_hleg_guidelines}.

\subsubsection{Ethical Purpose and Technical Robustness}

According to the AI HLEG guidelines, AI systems should respect fundamental rights and adhere to core principles and values to ensure an "ethical purpose." Additionally, AI systems must be technically robust and reliable to prevent unintentional harm, even when developed with good intentions \cite{ai_hleg_guidelines}. This is particularly important in the context of space missions, where AI systems must operate autonomously and make critical decisions.

\subsubsection{Addressing Bias and Accountability}

AI systems often rely on large datasets, which can introduce bias if not properly managed. Setting ethical parameters within which AI systems operate is essential to tackle bias, especially when dealing with data generated in space. Ensuring accountability in AI decision-making processes is also crucial, as it helps maintain trust and transparency in AI-driven operations \cite{house_of_commons_report}.

\subsection{Data Protection Strategies}

Data protection is a critical concern in the deployment of AI systems, given the vast amounts of data they process. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of sensitive information.

\subsubsection{Data Security Measures}

Effective data security measures include access management, sensitive information labeling, and user/group access rules. These measures help protect data integrity and confidentiality, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access Management:} Implementing strict access controls to limit data access to authorized users.
    \item \textbf{Sensitive Information Labeling:} Clearly labeling sensitive data to ensure proper handling and protection.
    \item \textbf{User/Group Access Rules:} Defining access rules based on user roles and responsibilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Standardization and Version Control}

Standardizing data formats and maintaining version control are essential for ensuring data consistency and traceability. This includes establishing labeling standards, column naming conventions, and data type and unit standards.

\begin{description}
    \item[Data Standardization:] Ensures uniformity in data representation, facilitating seamless integration and analysis.
    \item[Data Version Control:] Maintains a history of data changes, allowing for tracking and auditing of data modifications.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
