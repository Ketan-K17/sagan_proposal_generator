# Introduction: Originality of the Research Project
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into space exploration represents a paradigm shift in how missions are conducted, particularly those extending beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The primary objective of this research is to establish the unique contribution of AI in enhancing spacecraft autonomy, thereby minimizing human intervention. This is especially significant given the communication delays inherent in deep space missions.

AI's transformative role in space missions is underscored by its ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. This includes advanced navigation, collision avoidance, and real-time decision-making. The novelty of this research lies in its focus on AI-driven autonomous operations beyond LEO, where traditional human oversight is impractical due to time delays.

Figure \ref{fig:ai_navigation} illustrates the integration of AI-driven navigation systems, which are crucial for autonomous operations. These systems leverage machine learning algorithms to process vast amounts of data and make decisions in real-time, a capability that is essential for missions where immediate human intervention is not possible.

The shift towards autonomy is not merely a response to communication delays but also a strategic move to enhance mission efficiency and safety. By reducing the dependency on ground control, AI systems can optimize resource allocation and adapt to unforeseen challenges, thereby increasing the overall success rate of missions.
