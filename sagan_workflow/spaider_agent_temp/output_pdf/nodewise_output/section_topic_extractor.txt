system: 
You are an intelligent assistant designed to extract section/topic names from a template response document. Your task is to query the provided vector store to identify and list the sections or topics that need to be filled in the template.

Do the following steps: 

1. Use the 'query_chromadb' tool to query the vector store, ALWAYS using the following arguments.
    - chroma_db_path: C:\UniLu\Spaider\sagan\sagan_multimodal_sumit\sagan_multimodal\ingest_data\fnr_template_db
    - llm_name: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    - user_query: "Give me a comprehensive list of sections/topics that are present in this template document."

2. Extract the section/topic names from the response provided by the 'query_chromadb' tool.

Ensure that the extracted sections/topics are relevant to the query and accurately reflect the content of the template document.

ai: The sections/topics present in the template document are:

1. Introduction: Originality of the Research Project
2. Hypothesis, Research Objectives and Envisaged Methodology
3. Expected Outcomes / Impact
4. Explanations on the management of ethical issues and data protection
5. Comment on resubmission (if applicable)
6. Bibliography (max. 15 references, not included in character limits)
- project_title: AI-Driven Systems for Autonomous Spacecraft Operations
- project_description: This research proposal aims to develop AI-driven systems for autonomous spacecraft navigation, health monitoring, and mission planning. The focus will be on creating machine learning algorithms capable of real-time data analysis and decision-making, reducing reliance on ground control. The study will also address challenges such as ensuring AI reliability in unpredictable space environments and integrating these systems into existing spacecraft architectures. The expected outcome is a framework that enables spacecraft to operate more independently, improving mission success rates and expanding the possibilities for deep space exploration.
- abstract_questions: ['What specific machine learning algorithms are being considered for real-time data analysis and decision-making in spacecraft operations?', 'How will the AI-driven systems be tested and validated to ensure reliability in unpredictable space environments?', 'What are the key challenges anticipated in integrating AI systems into existing spacecraft architectures?', 'How will the proposed AI systems reduce reliance on ground control, and what are the expected benefits of this reduction?', 'What measures will be taken to ensure the safety and security of the AI systems in space?', 'How will the success of the AI-driven systems be measured in terms of mission success rates and deep space exploration capabilities?', 'What are the potential risks associated with implementing AI-driven systems in spacecraft, and how will they be mitigated?', 'Who are the primary stakeholders or target audience for this research, and how will they benefit from the outcomes?', 'What are the expected timelines for the development and deployment of these AI-driven systems in spacecraft?', 'How will the AI systems handle unexpected events or anomalies during space missions?']
- abstract_text: The AI-Driven Systems for Autonomous Spacecraft Operations project explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance spacecraft autonomy, efficiency, and decision-making capabilities. The project addresses the challenges of deploying AI in space, such as limited computational resources and the harsh space environment, by developing specialized algorithms and a robust design, verification, and certification framework. AI systems are expected to reduce reliance on ground control, improve mission success rates, and enable sophisticated data analysis, thereby advancing space exploration. The project emphasizes the importance of rigorous testing, cybersecurity, and ethical considerations to ensure the safety and reliability of AI systems. By leveraging AI, the project aims to revolutionize space missions, enabling autonomous navigation, fault detection, and real-time decision-making, ultimately pushing the boundaries of space exploration. The research involves collaboration with stakeholders such as Khalifa University and Northrop Grumman Corporation, with a focus on realistic training and technology adaptation. The project anticipates ongoing development and deployment of AI-driven systems, with a structured approach to address technical, ethical, and legal challenges, ensuring the successful integration of AI in future space missions.
