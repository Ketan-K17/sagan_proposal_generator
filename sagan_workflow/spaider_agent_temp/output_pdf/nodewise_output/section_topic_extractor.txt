You are an intelligent assistant designed to extract section/topic names from a template response document. Your task is to query the provided vector store to identify and list the sections or topics that need to be filled in the template.

Do the following steps: 

1. Use the 'query_chromadb' tool to query the vector store, ALWAYS using the following arguments.
    - chroma_db_path: C:\Users\ketan\Desktop\SPAIDER-SPACE\sagan_multimodal\ingest_data\fnr_template_db
    - llm_name: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    - user_query: "Give me a comprehensive list of sections/topics that are present in this template document."

2. Extract the section/topic names from the response provided by the 'query_chromadb' tool.

Ensure that the extracted sections/topics are relevant to the query and accurately reflect the content of the template document.

ai: The sections/topics present in the template document are:

1. Introduction: Originality of the Research Project
2. Hypothesis, Research Objectives and Envisaged Methodology
3. Expected Outcomes / Impact
4. Explanations on the management of ethical issues and data protection
5. Comment on resubmission (if applicable)
6. Bibliography (max. 15 references, not included in character limits)
- project_title: Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations
- project_description: This research proposal focuses on developing autonomous AI agents for spacecraft operations, specifically in Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS), as well as remote sensing. The vision is to create AI-driven agents capable of real-time communication with spacecraft systems and autonomously managing and controlling spacecraft functions. The objectives include reducing human involvement in mission-critical tasks, minimizing human error, and enhancing overall mission efficiency and safety. The proposal outlines expected technical innovations, such as advanced AI algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty and robust system integration. Challenges to address include ensuring AI reliability and effective decision-making in uncertain environments. The potential impacts on the space exploration industry include increased mission efficiency, safety, and reduced operational costs.
- abstract_questions: ['What are the primary objectives of implementing AI agents in spacecraft operations?', 'How do AI agents differ from traditional control systems in managing spacecraft operations?', 'What role does machine learning play in the development of AI agents for spacecraft?', 'How will AI agents handle unexpected events or anomalies during space missions?', 'What are the potential risks associated with deploying AI agents in space operations?', 'How will AI agents be tested and validated before deployment in actual missions?', 'What kind of data will AI agents require to function effectively in space operations?', 'How will AI agents interact with human operators during missions?', 'What are the long-term goals for AI integration in space exploration and operations?', 'How will the project ensure that AI agents remain adaptable to new technologies and mission requirements?']
- abstract_text: The Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations project aims to revolutionize space exploration by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into spacecraft operations, enhancing autonomy, efficiency, and mission success. AI agents are designed to reduce human intervention, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive responses to unforeseen events, crucial for interplanetary missions with communication delays. Machine learning (ML) techniques underpin these AI systems, allowing spacecraft to process data, control instruments, and navigate autonomously. Despite the transformative potential, deploying AI in space presents challenges, including validation, safety, and adaptability to new technologies and mission requirements. Rigorous testing and continuous validation are essential to ensure reliability and safety. AI's role extends to human-machine interaction, maintaining human oversight while maximizing situational awareness. The project envisions AI as a pivotal tool in mission design, planning, and execution, driving future advancements in space exploration and expanding human knowledge of the cosmos.
