You are an intelligent assistant designed to extract section/topic names from a template response document. Your task is to query the provided vector store to identify and list the sections or topics that need to be filled in the template.

Do the following steps: 

1. Use the 'query_chromadb' tool to query the vector store, ALWAYS using the following arguments.
    - chroma_db_path: C:\Users\ketan\Desktop\SPAIDER-SPACE\sagan_multimodal\ingest_data\fnr_template_db
    - llm_name: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    - user_query: "Give me a comprehensive list of sections/topics that are present in this template document."

2. Extract the section/topic names from the response provided by the 'query_chromadb' tool.

Ensure that the extracted sections/topics are relevant to the query and accurately reflect the content of the template document.

ai: The sections/topics present in the template document are:

1. Introduction: Originality of the Research Project
2. Hypothesis, Research Objectives and Envisaged Methodology
3. Expected Outcomes / Impact
4. Explanations on the management of ethical issues and data protection
5. Comment on resubmission (if applicable)
6. Bibliography (max. 15 references, not included in character limits)
- project_title: Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations
- project_description: This research proposal focuses on developing autonomous AI agents for spacecraft operations, specifically in Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS), as well as remote sensing. The vision is to create AI-driven agents capable of real-time communication with spacecraft systems and autonomously managing and controlling spacecraft functions. The objectives include reducing human involvement in mission-critical tasks, minimizing human error, and enhancing overall mission efficiency and safety. The proposal outlines expected technical innovations, such as improved AI reliability, decision-making under uncertainty, and seamless system integration. Challenges to address include ensuring AI reliability, effective decision-making under uncertainty, and successful integration with existing systems. The potential impacts on the space exploration industry include increased mission efficiency, safety, and reduced operational costs.
- abstract_questions: ['What are the primary objectives of integrating AI into GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control) and AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Systems) operations?', 'How do current spacecraft systems handle GNC and AOCS operations, and what limitations are present that AI could address?', 'What specific AI technologies or algorithms are being considered for real-time communication with spacecraft systems?', 'In what ways can AI improve decision-making processes in uncertain and dynamic space environments?', 'What are the existing challenges in integrating AI with spacecraft systems, and how does the project plan to overcome them?', 'How does the project plan to test and validate AI systems in simulated or real space environments?', 'What role will human operators play in monitoring and controlling AI agents during missions?', 'What are the potential failure modes of AI systems in space, and what contingency plans are in place?', 'How will the project evaluate the performance and impact of AI agents on mission outcomes?', 'What are the expected cost savings and efficiency gains from using AI in space missions, and how will these be measured?']
- abstract_text: The Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations project aims to revolutionize spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The primary objectives include enhancing spacecraft autonomy, reducing human intervention, and enabling real-time decision-making in dynamic space environments. AI's adaptability through machine learning techniques is being tailored for complex tasks such as satellite orbital control, collision avoidance, and autonomous mission planning. The project addresses current limitations in spacecraft operations by leveraging AI for on-board data processing, mission reconfiguration, and autonomous failure detection, supported by advancements in space-compatible hardware. Testing and validation of AI systems are crucial, focusing on reliability, safety, and explainability to ensure robust performance in space's harsh conditions. Human operators will maintain a supervisory role, ensuring transparency and accountability in AI decision-making. The project anticipates significant cost savings and efficiency gains, facilitating more ambitious exploration missions and advancing our understanding of the universe. Through structured systems engineering and rigorous testing, the project seeks to overcome challenges and fully integrate AI into space operations, paving the way for future innovations in space exploration.
