You are an intelligent assistant designed to extract section/topic names from a template response document. Your task is to query the provided vector store to identify and list the sections or topics that need to be filled in the template.

Do the following steps: 

1. Use the 'query_chromadb' tool to query the vector store, ALWAYS using the following arguments.
    - chroma_db_path: C:\UniLu\Spaider\sagan\sagan_multimodal_sumit\sagan_multimodal\ingest_data\fnr_template_db
    - llm_name: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    - user_query: "Give me a comprehensive list of sections/topics that are present in this template document."

2. Extract the section/topic names from the response provided by the 'query_chromadb' tool.

Ensure that the extracted sections/topics are relevant to the query and accurately reflect the content of the template document.

ai: The sections/topics present in the template document are:

1. Introduction: Originality of the Research Project
2. Hypothesis, Research Objectives and Envisaged Methodology
3. Expected Outcomes / Impact
4. Explanations on the management of ethical issues and data protection
5. Comment on resubmission (if applicable)
6. Bibliography (max. 15 references, not included in character limits)
- project_title: AI-Driven Autonomous Spacecraft Operations
- project_description: This research proposal aims to develop AI-driven systems for autonomous spacecraft navigation, health monitoring, and mission planning. The focus will be on creating machine learning algorithms capable of real-time data analysis and decision-making, reducing reliance on ground control. The study will also address challenges such as ensuring AI reliability in unpredictable space environments and integrating these systems into existing spacecraft architectures. The expected outcome is a framework that enables spacecraft to operate more independently, improving mission success rates and expanding the possibilities for deep space exploration.
- abstract_questions: ['What machine learning algorithms are suitable for real-time data analysis in space?', 'How can AI systems be validated for reliability in space environments?', 'What challenges exist in integrating AI into spacecraft?', 'How can AI reduce reliance on ground control in space missions?', 'What safety measures are necessary for AI systems in space?', 'How is success measured in AI-driven spacecraft operations?', 'What risks are associated with AI in space, and how can they be mitigated?', 'How do AI systems manage unexpected events in space?', 'What goals are set for AI in enhancing mission success and exploration?', 'Who benefits from AI research in spacecraft operations?']
- abstract_text: The AI-Driven Autonomous Spacecraft Operations project explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and autonomy of space missions. By integrating AI into satellite operations, data analysis, robotics, and autonomous spacecraft, the project aims to reduce human intervention and increase operational efficiency, enabling more ambitious exploration endeavors. The research highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms for real-time data analysis, image processing, and anomaly detection, which are crucial for space-based systems. It also addresses the challenges of ensuring AI reliability in harsh space environments, advocating for a dedicated AI design, verification, and certification framework to ensure system integrity and resilience. The project identifies key challenges in mission design, planning, and Earth observation, demonstrating AI's capability to provide robust solutions and facilitate scientific advancements. By reducing reliance on ground control, AI enhances mission success and exploration, allowing spacecraft to adapt to changing conditions and make real-time decisions. The research underscores the importance of addressing technical, ethical, and legal challenges to optimize AI benefits while mitigating risks, ultimately contributing to significant scientific advancements and discoveries in space exploration.
