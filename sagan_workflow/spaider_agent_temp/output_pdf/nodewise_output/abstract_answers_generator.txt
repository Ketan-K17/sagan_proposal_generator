ABSTRACT_TEXT: The Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations project aims to revolutionize space exploration by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems into spacecraft operations. The primary objectives include enhancing spacecraft autonomy, reducing human intervention, and improving mission efficiency and accuracy. AI agents are designed to handle real-time decision-making, goal generation, and autonomous corrective actions, crucial for missions with communication delays. These agents differ from traditional control systems by enabling adaptive control, fault tolerance, and collision avoidance, thus minimizing reliance on ground control. Machine learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in developing these AI agents, allowing them to learn from data and adapt to dynamic space environments. The project addresses challenges such as data transmission and processing in space by leveraging robust hardware and innovative strategies. Collaborations with organizations like NASA and ESA are integral to advancing AI capabilities. Despite potential risks, such as system reliability in harsh conditions and ethical considerations, the project promises significant advancements in space exploration, paving the way for ambitious future missions.
