Q: What are the primary objectives of integrating AI into GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control) and AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Systems) operations?
A: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly impacting aerospace research, particularly in the realm of autonomous guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. AI's adaptability and diversity, through machine learning techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, are being tailored to meet various needs in GNC, from feasibility studies to on-board applications. This convergence towards autonomy and adaptability in GNC systems is crucial for reducing human intervention during spacecraft missions.

AI technologies are being utilized to enhance the autonomy of spacecraft by enabling them to perform complex tasks such as controlling satellite orbital parameters, performing advanced navigation tasks like DSS relative navigation and formation flight, and enhancing surveillance tasks, including tracking other spacecraft and debris. AI can infer the state vector of tracked objects, allowing for orbital propagation to identify collision risks and implement optimal maneuvers for collision avoidance when necessary.

The development of autonomous spacecraft has been greatly facilitated by AI, allowing them to make independent decisions in real-time, adapt to unforeseen circumstances, and optimize mission objectives. This reduces reliance on ground control systems and enables more ambitious exploration missions.

Q: How does the project plan to test and validate AI systems in simulated or real space environments?
A: Deploying AI/ML systems in space environments presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of these models, often perceived as black boxes, and the distinct processing hardware used in space vehicles compared to those used during model training. This complexity necessitates extensive testing to ensure the models perform reliably across different environments, such as FPGA, GPU, or CPU, and to address safety, security, and legal requirements, including liability for potential damages. The AI/ML workflow involves five key steps: Prepare, Model, Optimize, Integrate, and Certify. Each step requires careful consideration of the components and functions involved, as well as the differences and similarities in developing for various environments. Testing should encompass resource consumption, system/environment interactions, and security vulnerabilities, with a focus on detecting anomalous data and bias during the prepare and model steps. The entire AI/ML system, including data ingestion, model inference, and decision-making processes, must be validated against consistent metrics to identify bottlenecks and performance issues. Best practices for engineering AI systems in resource-constrained environments are essential, as is the need for explainability and certification to build trust in these systems. Reinforcement learning and other AI advancements continue to drive innovation, emphasizing the importance of validation methods to enhance trust in trained models.

Q: What role will human operators play in monitoring and controlling AI agents during missions?
A: In the context of aerospace, achieving trusted autonomy involves integrating human-on-the-loop control, where human operators supervise and guide autonomous systems, intervening when necessary. This approach maximizes human situational awareness and ensures correct interpretation of various situations. AI plays a crucial role in enhancing the cognitive adaptation capabilities of these systems, enabling them to handle the complex, unpredictable, and dynamic nature of real-world environments. The transition towards higher levels of autonomy requires changes in operational processes, practices, and tools, facilitating a common understanding between ground personnel and onboard algorithms. This evolution is evident in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS), where human operators are shifting to high-level supervisory roles. AI systems, like those used in SpaceX satellites, can independently solve problems and adjust positions to avoid collisions, demonstrating the potential of AI to maintain satellite health and control orbital paths. However, the integration of AI in decision-making systems must ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability, with a focus on explainability and interpretability to support human-autonomy interactions. As autonomous technologies advance, they will play a crucial role in both unmanned and manned space missions, offering precision, redundancy, and the ability to operate in environments beyond human reach.

Q: What are the potential failure modes of AI systems in space, and what contingency plans are in place?
