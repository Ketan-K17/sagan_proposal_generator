The proposal should outline a vision for AI-driven agents capable of not only facilitating real-time communication with spacecraft systems but also autonomously managing and controlling spacecraft functions. Emphasize how these agents will reduce human involvement in mission-critical tasks, minimize human error, and enhance overall mission efficiency and safety. Include detailed objectives, expected technical innovations, challenges to address (such as AI reliability, decision-making under uncertainty, and system integration), and potential impacts on the space exploration industry.",
