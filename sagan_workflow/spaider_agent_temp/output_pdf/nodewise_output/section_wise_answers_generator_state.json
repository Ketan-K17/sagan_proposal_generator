    "project_description": "This research proposal focuses on developing autonomous AI agents for spacecraft operations, specifically in Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS), as well as remote sensing. The vision is to create AI-driven agents capable of real-time communication with spacecraft systems and autonomously managing and controlling spacecraft functions. The objectives include reducing human involvement in mission-critical tasks, minimizing human error, and enhancing overall mission efficiency and safety. The proposal outlines expected technical innovations, such as advanced AI algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty and reliable system integration. Challenges to address include ensuring AI reliability and effective decision-making. The potential impacts on the space exploration industry include increased mission efficiency, safety, and reduced operational costs.",

    "abstract_text": "The Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations project aims to revolutionize spacecraft operations by integrating advanced AI technologies into guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, as well as attitude and orbit control systems (AOCS). These AI agents are designed to enhance mission autonomy, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptation to unforeseen circumstances with minimal human intervention. Key innovations include high-integrity algorithms for autonomous mission planning, intelligent docking, and fault-tolerant systems to ensure stability and collision avoidance. The project addresses challenges in AI reliability, emphasizing explainability, safety, and legal compliance to mitigate risks associated with autonomous operations. By reducing human involvement in mission-critical tasks, AI agents aim to increase mission efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enable more ambitious exploration missions. The integration of AI into existing spacecraft systems will be managed through iterative algorithms and robust communication technologies, ensuring seamless human-machine interactions. The project envisions a future where AI-driven spacecraft operations enhance scientific returns, support human missions, and facilitate the exploration of new frontiers in space.",
