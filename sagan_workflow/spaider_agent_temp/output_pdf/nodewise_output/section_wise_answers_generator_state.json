    "project_description": "This research proposal focuses on developing autonomous AI agents for spacecraft operations, specifically in Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS), as well as remote sensing. The vision is to create AI-driven agents capable of real-time communication with spacecraft systems and autonomously managing and controlling spacecraft functions. The objectives include reducing human involvement in mission-critical tasks, minimizing human error, and enhancing mission efficiency and safety. The proposal outlines expected technical innovations, such as improved AI reliability, decision-making under uncertainty, and seamless system integration. Challenges to address include ensuring AI reliability, effective decision-making under uncertainty, and successful system integration. The potential impacts on the space exploration industry include increased mission efficiency, safety, and reduced operational costs.",

    "abstract_text": "The Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations project aims to revolutionize space missions by integrating advanced AI technologies into Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS). The project focuses on developing AI agents capable of autonomous decision-making, mission planning, and multi-agent coordination without human intervention. These agents are tested in complex scenarios, such as the TANGO satellite mission, to validate their performance in sensor technologies and space rendezvous. The project addresses technical challenges, including the integration of AI with existing systems, ensuring reliability in harsh space conditions, and maintaining adaptability in dynamic environments. Ethical and safety concerns are prioritized, with a focus on explainability, transparency, and compliance with legal standards. Human operators will oversee AI agents through a \"human-on-the-loop\" model, ensuring strategic oversight while leveraging AI's precision and speed. The project anticipates long-term implications for space exploration, enhancing mission efficiency and expanding human capabilities in space. Through rigorous testing and validation, the project aims to establish industry standards for AI deployment in space, ensuring robust, fault-tolerant, and ethically sound operations.",
