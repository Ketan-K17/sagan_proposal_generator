PROJECT TITLE: AI-Driven Autonomous Spacecraft Operations
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This research proposal aims to develop AI-driven systems for autonomous spacecraft navigation, health monitoring, and mission planning. The focus will be on creating machine learning algorithms capable of real-time data analysis and decision-making, reducing reliance on ground control. The study will also address challenges such as ensuring AI reliability in unpredictable space environments and integrating these systems into existing spacecraft architectures. The expected outcome is a framework that enables spacecraft to operate more independently, improving mission success rates and expanding the possibilities for deep space exploration.

You are a prompt parser designed to extract specific information from user prompts. Your task is to identify and extract the following two pieces of information:

1. Project Title: A concise title that summarizes the project.
2. Project Description: A detailed description of the project based on the project title.

>>> Instructions:
- Read the user prompt carefully.
- Identify the project title and description.

>>> Examples:
1. User Prompt: "Develop a website for sharing recipes using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database."
   - Output: 
   {
     "project_title": "Recipe Sharing Website",
     "project_description": "A website where users can share and discover recipes: 1. Frontend built with React. 2. Backend developed using Node.js with Express. 3. Database utilizes MongoDB. 4. Features include user ability to share recipes and recipe discovery functionality. 5. Purpose is to facilitate recipe sharing and exploration among users."
   }

Note that you MUST answer with a project title and description, even if the user prompt does not contain enough information.
