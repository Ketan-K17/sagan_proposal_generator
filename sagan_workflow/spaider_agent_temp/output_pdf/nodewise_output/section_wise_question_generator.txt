ABSTRACT_TEXT: The Autonomous AI Agents for Spacecraft Operations project aims to revolutionize space exploration by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into spacecraft systems. The primary objectives include enhancing decision-making, real-time scheduling, and autonomous operations within Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS). AI agents are designed to maintain satellite health, optimize orbital parameters, and perform collision avoidance, thereby increasing mission autonomy and reducing human intervention. These agents facilitate real-time communication and decision-making, crucial for missions with limited Earth contact, exemplified by AI-driven Mars rovers. The project anticipates technical advancements that will improve mission efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness, enabling more ambitious exploration missions. AI's role extends to optimizing satellite constellations and managing mission-critical tasks autonomously, reducing operational costs and enhancing mission resilience. The project addresses AI reliability under uncertain conditions through probabilistic methods and robust system architectures. Integration strategies involve training AI models on the ground and deploying them onboard spacecraft, ensuring seamless operation with existing systems. Success is evaluated based on mission efficiency, safety, and the ability to handle uncertainty. While reducing human involvement poses risks, the project employs robust safety measures and innovative management strategies to mitigate these challenges. The financial implications include maximizing returns on investment by reducing costs and enhancing mission capabilities. Long-term, AI agents are expected to expand mission complexity and scope, supporting exploration in environments unsuitable for human presence and advancing our understanding of the universe.
