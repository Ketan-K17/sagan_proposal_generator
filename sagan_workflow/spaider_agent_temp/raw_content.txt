possible with AI/ML in space it is necessary to have an understanding of the di\ufb00erent types of\nprocessors or   
accelerators that are available for computation and their capabilities. Here we provide a brief overview of\nseveral 
types of processors and highlight their strengths and weaknesses for performing AI/ML acceleration in space.",
