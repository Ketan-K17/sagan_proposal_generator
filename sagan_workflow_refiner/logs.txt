# 3: Expected Outcomes / Impact



## Industry and Policy Implications
The FNR places significant emphasis on the impact of research outputs on science, industry, policy making, and society at large. To maximize the potential impact, FNR-funded research results are expected to be disseminated through high-quality, Open Access publications, in line with the FNR Policy on Open Access. This includes the encouragement of preprints in open access repositories. Applicants are required to list the value and impact of all research outputs, including publications, data, software, and training of young scientists. The FNR also supports the dissemination of research to the general public and media, emphasizing the need for impact-generating activities from the project's inception. Furthermore, the FNR is committed to the principles of the European Charter for Researchers, ensuring that projects align with European standards and practices. Public-private partnerships are encouraged, with a significant portion of research time spent in collaboration with industry partners. The FNR provides funding support for project-related publications through its Open Access Fund, ensuring that research outputs are accessible and impactful across various sectors.


## Scientific and Societal Impact
The FNR emphasizes the importance of evaluating research outputs beyond traditional research articles, considering a diverse range of contributions such as data, reagents, software, mentoring, intellectual property, and societal outreach. Applicants are encouraged to focus on the content and quality of their scientific outputs rather than relying on journal-based metrics like Journal Impact Factors. The FNR, as a signatory of the DORA declaration, supports the dissemination of research through Open Access publications to maximize impact on science, industry, policy making, and society. It is crucial to account for legitimate delays in research activities due to personal factors and to ensure diversity and inclusion in all research-related activities. The FNR also highlights the importance of planning for the impact of research from the project's inception and encourages the training and career development of young scientists, particularly in AFR bilateral projects. Researchers should be aware of unconscious bias and strive to foster diversity, especially in recruitment processes.
