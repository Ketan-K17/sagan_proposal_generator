innovation in several sectors. Notably, in the space sector, AI is helping scientists and
industries provide robust solutions to the most relevant problems, but most of all, AI
enables discoveries. The problems that AI addresses are categorized into three main areas:

with limited data, such biases are expected to become increasingly se­

logical challenges associated to different application areas. 
As of now, AI in space is limited to offline data processing and has not 
been adopted “on the edge” within the spacecraft [264]. When looking

collect more data, make better judgements and conduct space explora­
tion in a safer manner [264,265]. 
5. Space infrastructure evolution 
The benefits offered by AI algorithms will be fully achieved upon 
integration in all space mission operational segments (Fig. 24): space, 
control, user, link segments and inter-vehicle communications.

significantly affect human and robotic space exploration missions in 
several different ways. 
As time progresses, AI will complement the space exploration ac­
tivities in a variety of ways, as seen in Fig. 23. Some of the main ap­
plications of AI and intelligent systems in the near-Earth region and 
multi-planetary exploration in outer space are:
