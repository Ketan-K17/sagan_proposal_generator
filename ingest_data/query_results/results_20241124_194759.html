                    <p>Computer Science is the result of an evolution of ideas, viewpoints and 
methodologies that started out earlier in the human history with respect to the 
invention of computers. In general, the path that led to the definition of Artificial 
Intelligence as a discipline can be described under several different lights: in any 
case, four distinct incentives and pushes can be identified in the areas of philosophy, 
mathematics, economics and neuro-science.

Philosophy 
Earliest records of automating 
human reasoning date back to Aristotle 
(III B.C. century) that formulated a 
methodology to rule the rational sphere 
of the mind. He developed an informal 
system of syllogisms for proper 
reasoning, which allowed to obtain 
definitive conclusions given initial 
premises. After him, the mechanization 
of the thinking act was explored by Lull 
(XIV 
century),
