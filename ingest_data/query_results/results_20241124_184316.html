• Operations are likely to require new types of information

autonomy modules). This is a particular area of challenge,

An exemplary DSS software architecture is shown in Fig. 12, where 
the corresponding hardware modules are not homogenous, indicating 
they have different computational capabilities and availability times (i. 
e., system encapsulation). The system consists of various autonomy

spacecraft in synergy with one another. The Distributed System Layer 
(DSL) provides a common communication link between global and local...</p></div></div>

Fig. 15 shows an evolutionary roadmap of space system capabilities 
with a growing degree of autonomy over time. The four categories are 
defined as follows: (1) teleoperation (operated from Earth); (2) auto­
matic operation (pre-programmed self-controls); (3) semi-autonomous 
operation (start with predefined command sequence, where machine 
adapts to the external environment); and (4) fully autonomous opera­
tion (autonomous decision making (goal-oriented)) [74]. Autonomy can...</p></div></div></body></html>
