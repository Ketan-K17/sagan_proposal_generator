                    <p>A whole-process R&D system is not in place. As a consequence, the analysis and processing of test data has not 
directly benefited product design at present [7-9]. 
A knowledge-driven approach to product design and optimization, on the other hand, seeks to create 
interactions between test data and product design. Unlike the traditional method, each model will be designed 
using test data as the basis and core.

Test data are compared with parameters of the designed model in an intelligent manner by the test evaluation 
system. Multidimensional elements are identified, such as performance parameters, temperature, mechanical 
properties, and external environmental parameters, and they are compared with design indicators. Through 
simulation and redesign, an optimized product design will be generated. This approach can maximize system...</p>

5.7 Knowledge-based Engineering and Expert Systems 
The section deals with knowledge-related algorithms and applications. The term 
knowledge itself denotes familiarity, awareness, understanding of a process or a 
situation, such as facts, information, descriptions or skills, which are acquired 
through experience or education, by perceiving, discovering, or learning [62].
