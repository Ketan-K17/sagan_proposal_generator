In the previous sections we compared the three major types of computational units available in the space environment.
In this section we look at the currently available processors utilized in space and compare them to what will and may be
available in the near future. The primary metric we use for comparing computational performance is Giga-Floating-Point...</p>

To know what is possible with AI/ML in space it is necessary to have an understanding of the diﬀerent types of
processors or accelerators that are available for computation and their capabilities. Here we provide a brief overview of
several types of processors and highlight their strengths and weaknesses for performing AI/ML acceleration in space....</p>
