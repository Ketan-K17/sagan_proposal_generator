COTS processors is considerably higher than the average rad-hard solution found 
in spacecraft. However, despite the average performances, interesting solutions 
from the rad-hard domain are also appearing, and this makes the separation between 
COTS and rad-hard processors somewhat smaller when interpreted from a 
performance point of view [57]. Even if from a cost perspective the comparison...</p></div></div>

In the previous sections we compared the three major types of computational units available in the space environment.
In this section we look at the currently available processors utilized in space and compare them to what will and may be
available in the near future. The primary metric we use for comparing computational performance is Giga-Floating-Point...</p></div></div>

metrics (if not all of them) are usually captured and speciﬁed
early in the mission, or at the strategic planning level.

To know what is possible with AI/ML in space it is necessary to have an understanding of the diﬀerent types of
processors or accelerators that are available for computation and their capabilities. Here we provide a brief overview of
several types of processors and highlight their strengths and weaknesses for performing AI/ML acceleration in space....</p></div></div>
