4.2. AI in space operations 
The field of data-driven AI has a wealth of valuable and adaptable 
tools that can be used in various applications with minimal enhance­
ments. While AI has been used successfully in space, it is still constrained 
to offline data processing but has not yet been utilised fully “on the 
edge” within spacecraft. Space Applications of AI has the potential to...</p>
