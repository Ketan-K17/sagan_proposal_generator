COTS and rad-hard processors somewhat smaller when interpreted from a

C. Space Hardware Landscape
In the previous sections we compared the three major types of computational units available in the space environment.
In this section we look at the currently available processors utilized in space and compare them to what will and may be
available in the near future. The primary metric we use for comparing computational performance is Giga-Floating-Point...</p>
