Our research project aims to determine precise orbital trajectories of asteroids in our solar system. We're developing advanced computational methods and algorithms to improve asteroid tracking and prediction. Our sophisticated system processes astronomical observations from various sources to calculate accurate orbital parameters, accounting for subtle forces like solar radiation pressure and the Yarkovsky effect. Key challenges include developing robust statistical methods, implementing advanced orbit determination algorithms, and creating a comprehensive database. We're combining classical orbital mechanics with modern computational techniques, including machine learning. The project will deliver practical tools for the astronomical community and has significant implications for planetary defense and solar system dynamics understanding.




Write a comprehensive research proposal focused on the development of autonomous AI agents for spacecraft operations in GNC and AOCS operations and also remote sensing. The proposal should outline a vision for AI-driven agents capable of not only facilitating real-time communication with spacecraft systems but also autonomously managing and controlling spacecraft functions. Emphasize how these agents will reduce human involvement in mission-critical tasks, minimize human error, and enhance overall mission efficiency and safety. Include detailed objectives, expected technical innovations, challenges to address (such as AI reliability, decision-making under uncertainty, and system integration), and potential impacts on the space exploration industry.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are revolutionizing spacecraft operations by enhancing autonomy, efficiency, and decision-making capabilities. This research proposal aims to develop AI-driven systems for autonomous spacecraft navigation, health monitoring, and mission planning. The focus will be on creating machine learning algorithms capable of real-time data analysis and decision-making, reducing reliance on ground control. The study will also address challenges such as ensuring AI reliability in unpredictable space environments and integrating these systems into existing spacecraft architectures. The expected outcome is a framework that enables spacecraft to operate more independently, improving mission success rates and expanding the possibilities for deep space exploration.
